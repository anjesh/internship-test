## What's wrong with the form?

### What you need to do

* Take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) if you haven’t already.
* Create a private repo called “yipl-form-wrong” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Solve the problem below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple number of commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship-bitbucket@yipl.com.np to that particular private repo


#### Problem

Copy the following [folder](code) in your php enabled web server. 
Access the [form](code/form.php) from the browser.

Write what is wrong with the given form. Give as many issues as possible. Create a text file "issues.txt" and list all the issues there. Push this file into the given repo. 

Fix the [form code](code/form.php) to address the issues you have identified and push the code in the same repo.

### Bonus points

* If you write the UI test code to test against your scenarios. 

Note: If you are creating a separate class file, your class filename should be "logprocessor.php", "logprocessor.py" and so on for other languages.
