## Process the log

### What you need to do

* Take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/learn/git) if you haven’t already.
* Create a private repo called “yipl-log-processor” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Solve the problem below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple number of commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship-bitbucket@yipl.com.np to that particular private repo


#### Problem

You have a log file with the content as shown below. You need to write code that reads the log file, processes its content and gives the summary of the logs as shown in output section below. The code should be written in any one of the following programming languages (node, python, php, golang). 

The filename should be process.php, process.py, process.js or process.go based on the language of your choice.

Your code should run from the cli as shown below. If you don’t know how to use cli in one of the given languages, time to learn it as well. 

In php, 
`php run.php`
In python, 
`python run.py`
In node,
`node run.js`
In go,
`./run`

Running the above command should give the following output
```
2016-12-12 warning:2 error: 1
2016-12-13 warning:0 error: 1
2016-12-14 warning:1 error: 1
```

### Bonus points

* If you could write unit tests for your code. 
* If you write readme file with necessary instruction to run the code

Note: If you are creating a separate class file, your class filename should be "logprocessor.php", "logprocessor.py" and so on for other languages.
