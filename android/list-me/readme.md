## List me

### What you need to do?

* If you haven’t already, take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git).
* Once complete, create a private repo called “yipl-android-list-me”” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Solve the problem detailed below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship-bitbucket@yipl.com.np to that particular private repo

#### Problem

Implement a simple listing and detail showcase application using the following APIs:

* For listing: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/
* For details: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{id}/comments

Checkout [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for more details.

Once loaded, the data (both listing and detail) should persist. Any persistence mechanism can be used, i.e., cache or database. 

Design is important, but can be designed as you wish.

#### Criteria for judgement

* Object Oriented approach used in project.
* Proper use of naming conventions for XML and Java files.
* Proper use of ViewGroup(s) and View(s).
* Proper use of Android API(s).
* Project structure.

### Bonus points

* Use of 3rd party libraries like [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) or any ORM libraries would be a big plus.
* If you can demonstrate the correct use of relevant 'Material Design' components in your application.
* If you write a readme file which contains screenshots and a short description of your application.
