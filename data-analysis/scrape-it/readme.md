## Scrape it

### What you need to do

* Take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) if you haven’t already.
* Create a private repo called “yipl-scrape-it” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Solve the problem below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple number of commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship-bitbucket@yipl.com.np to that particular private repo

#### Problem

Write code to scrape the data from the following [html page](https://cdn.rawgit.com/anjesh/internship-test/master/data-analysis/scrape-it/exampledata.html) in any one of the following programming languages (node, python, php, golang). If you don’t know what scraping is, it’s time to learn now. 

The filename should be run.php, run.py, run.js or run.go.

Your code should run from the cli as shown below. If you don’t know how to use cli in one of the given languages, time to learn it as well. 

In php, 
`php run.php`

In python, 
`python run.py`

In node,
`node run.js`

In go,
`go run run.go`

Your run script should create a folder called "out" and write a file "data.csv" inside "data" folder.
"data.csv" should contain the data as this "file"

### Bonus points

* If you write unit tests for your code
* If you write readme file with necessary instruction to run the code

**Note**: If you are creating a separate class file and accessing that class file from your run script, your class filename should be "scraper.php", "scraper.py" and so on for other languages.
