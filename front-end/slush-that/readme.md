## Docker me

### What you need to do

* Take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) if you haven’t already.
* Create a private repo called “yipl-slush-that” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Solve the problem below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple number of commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship-bitbucket@yipl.com.np to that particular private repo


#### Problem

1. You'll receive an invite from Zeplin. To learn more about Zeplin, click here: https://zeplin.io/
2. Using Zeplin, you'll be able to open a project called "Slush Nepal"
3. You'll then be able to see 3 screens 
* Landing Page
* FAQ
* Final_Slush Nepal
4. Your assignment is to turn "Landing Page" screen into an interactive web page using HTML/ CSS (if possible JS). You don't have to implement FAQ and Final_Slush Nepal
5. Upload the html/css file into your repo

We'll be looking into following aspects of your assignment:
- How well the webpage you've made matches with the design file in Zeplin
- HTML/ CSS structure 
- Use of proper tag 
- Naming convention of class names
- Use of shorthand properties
- Folder structure
- Responsiveness (Plus point)
