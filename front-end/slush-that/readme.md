## Slush that design

### What you need to do

* If you haven't already done so, take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git).
* Once complete, create a private repo called “yipl-slush-that” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Solve the problem detailed below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship-bitbucket@yipl.com.np to that particular private repo


#### Problem

1. You'll receive an invite from a design tool called 'Zeplin'. To learn more about Zeplin, click here: https://zeplin.io/
2. Using Zeplin, you'll be able to access and open a project called "Slush Nepal"
3. Once opne, you'll  be able to see 3 different screens: 
 - Landing Page
 - FAQ
 - Final_Slush Nepal
4. Your assignment is to turn the "Landing Page" screen into an interactive web page using HTML/ CSS (if possible JS). You don't have to implement or do anything with the FAQ and Final_Slush Nepal screens. Ignore them.
5. Upload the html/css file into your repo

We'll be looking into following aspects of your assignment and using them as judging criteria:
- How well the webpage you've made matches with the design file in Zeplin
- The HTML/ CSS structure 
- Use of proper tags
- Naming convention of class names
- Use of shorthand properties
- Folder structure
- Responsiveness (Plus point)
